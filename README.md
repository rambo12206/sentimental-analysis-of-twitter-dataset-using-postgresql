## Description of project:

In this project I have performed sentimental analysis using textblob and postgresql as a database for storing the live streaming tweets.
I have selected the topic 'Trump' i.e all the tweets are regarding Donald Trump. I have used twiter developer account and tweepy library in order to extract live tweets.
In this project I have tried to know about the sentiments of the twitter users regarding Donald Trump i.e whether he is being liked among the users or not.The live tweets were extracted before the US presidential election 2020.
